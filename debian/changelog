github-backup-utils (1.1.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Updated documentation on minimum GitHub Enterprise version requirements for
    online and incremental backups from v11.10.341 to at least v11.10.342.
  * The ghe-restore command now prompts for confirmation of the host to restore to
    before performing any destructive operation. This is to reduce the chances of
    restoring to the wrong host. The prompt may be bypassed in automated scenarios
    by providing the --force option.
  * Added a -c option to ghe-restore for restoring base appliance settings in
    addition to primary datastores. See ghe-restore --help for more information.
  * Added a note about disabling maintenance mode on the appliance after a
    successful ghe-restore operation.
  * Added support for filesystem layout changes and upgraded server components in
  * future versions of GitHub Enterprise.
